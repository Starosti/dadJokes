My (almost) first Angular project! A really basic website that calls to icanhazdadjoke.com API and returns a joke with Angular's HttpClient.

This is also the first time that I used SASS/SCSS, it's pretty cool!

If you clone this project, do an `npm install` before running it, to make sure you have the dependencies.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
